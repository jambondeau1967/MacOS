Brew or Homebrew

source:
https://brew.sh

1. install xcode-tools
-- document xcode-tools install in this repo.
Brew install will show a pop-up to install xcode-tools. 
It might take while, that is why I like to do it in advance.

2. open terminal, then copy the next line after prompt and press enter:
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
