You might need this if you want to use Homebrew for example.

open terminal and type:
xcode-select â€”install
press enter --> do you want to install now..: yes.

It might take a while.. 

Now you have tools in the next directory:

/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/
Note: this is NOT your home Library directory (~/Library) !
